<h1 align="center"> DocBranch 📄🌿 </h1>

<div align="center">
A version-control tool for documents where “the latest might not be the greatest.”  
DocBranch helps users manage and visualize variations of their resumes (or other documents) over time.  
By offering side-by-side comparisons, branching history, and AI-driven summaries, it allows users to efficiently reuse past work and adapt documents to new opportunities.

## Summary ✍️
Many college students—especially in fields like Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and other broad STEM areas—must tailor dozens of resumes for internships and jobs.  
The details matter: one small tweak to a bullet point could mean the difference between an interview and rejection.  

Traditional file systems make it easy to lose track of changes, overwrite good versions, or waste time rewriting from scratch.  
**DocBranch** solves this by providing a structured, visual version-control system for resumes and documents, making it easy to branch, merge, compare, and refine documents across many applications.
Serving as a tool to augment the process of writing, tailoring, or editing a resume (or any document for that matter), DocBranch's intuitive user flow, integral tools, and additional A.I. insight keep you focused on the most important pieces of the puzzle.

## MVP 🏆
- **Resume Cloud Upload**  
  Bulk upload all resume versions into secure cloud storage, accessible on any device.
- **Offline Access**  
  Local SQLite database stores and syncs file states for offline use.
- **File Relationship Tracker**  
  Parent/child file tracking with branching support (resume “lineages”).  
  - Stretch: Support for multiple parents (merged documents).
- **Branching System**  
  Users can define and label branches either at a split (multiple children) or along any lineage.
- **Side-by-Side Resume Display**  
  Compare any two resumes across branches.
- **Parent-Child Resume Visualization**  
  View document history with AI-generated notes summarizing meaningful differences between versions.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**  
  Rearranging files directly updates their lineage relationships.
- **Resume Search**  
  Search by:
  - Date
  - Company/Position (via tags)
  - Branch name  
  - Job description (AI returns most relevant resumes)

## Stretch Goals 🌟
- **Built-in LaTeX Editor** for advanced editing.
- **AI-Driven Resume Editing** that generates resumes based on user instructions.  
  - Support for LaTeX and Word documents.
- **Generalized Document Support** beyond PDFs.
- **Resume Quality Scoring** to help users prioritize strong drafts.
